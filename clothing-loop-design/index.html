          <h5>Project Overview</h5>
          <p>
            The Clothing Loop is a clothing swap system that allows you to share pre-loved clothes by connecting people
            in local communities who share a bag of clothes. <br />
            <mark>The Clothing Loop won the What Design Can Do competition set up
              by Impact Hub.</mark>
            <br />
            The initiative started in The Netherlands in early 2020 as a local
            alternative for clothing swap events during the lockdown. <br />
            <br />
            The initiative tackles the growing problem of overconsumption. It
            aims to change consumers habits and reduce waste, providing a fun
            and sustainable alternative to fast fashion. Currently, there are
            300 actively circulating bags and over <mark>12,000 users.</mark>

        <h1>Role</h1>
        <p>
          As part of my role as a UI designer for The Clothing Loop, I lead
          the design process and production of the web application.<br />
          Alongside my contribution, I teamed up with a professional UX/UI
          designer, to enrich the user-onboarding experience and automate the
          initiative's global expansion. <br />
          I conducted user testing, outlined user journeys and designed
          features.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Initial product</h1>
        <p>
          The initial phase of the platform development included a very basic
          UI with the following functionalities:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Automated user signup flow
            <div class="img-wrapper">
              <img src="../images/old-form.png" alt="" />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Interactive data visualization through a map view

            <div class="img-wrapper">
              <img src="../images/old-map.png" alt="" />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Data management through a corresponding backoffice</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Design thinking approach</h1>
        <p>
          The initial part involved outlining the key challenges, which I
          summarized as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Help users to find an existing loop in a convenient location
          </li>
          <li>Help users to initiate a loop</li>
          <li>Help volunteers to manage and securely store user data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I began structuring the design process by leading a user-centered
          research with the aim of pinpointing strength and weaknesses of the
          essential features. As no data was available to identify problems, I
          conducted an early-stage user interview. This helped me to gather
          qualitative data on features that were already built. I was able to
          interview a variety of different user types - some familiar with the
          initiative and others not. Early-stage user interviews, were a
          fundamental step to test features and quickly reiterate over them
          before globally launch the platform. Some of the most significant
          insights were:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            "Steps to initiate a new bag of clothes to share are not clear"
          </li>

          <li>
            "Search and filter functionalities are not intuitive and well-designed"
          </li>
          <li>
            "Displaying a the shared bag of clothes as a marker in the map is not
            intuitive"
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Redesign process: wireframes</h1>

        <p>
          After having reviewed all qualitative data gathered during users
          interviews, I started to prioritize the features to implement. And
          then moving onto the first wireframes iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first feature to be tackled was the 'new loop' sign up form,
          which breaks down into two forms: 1. new user signup form, 2. form
          to select the area in which a new bar circulates.<br />
          For this feature reiteration, was introduced a progress bar to track
          the signup process, an interactive map in which the user can select
          the approximate area in which the bag of clothes circulates and
          implemented a cleaner UI.
        </p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="../images/wireframes-two.svg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Followed by search and filter functionalities of the map
          visualization. Below, some of the wireframes of the above features
          that were produced as part of the redesigning process. For this
          feature reiteration, was introduced the option to search by location
          which on submit sets the map's viewport to the searched location.
          Also, the filters by categories and sizes was implemented by
          refining size ranges and programmatically giving filter parameters
          based on user selection. <br />
          The UI for these functionalities was also implemented and included
          within a unique search bar, just above the map.
        </p>

        <div class="img-wrapper">
          <img src="../images/wireframes-one.svg" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Next, was tackled the issue of consistently display the various
          active bags of clothes on the map. Markers were replaced by blurred
          circles with mutable radius values based on the user input (when
          initiating a new entry). The circles represent the area in which a
          bag of clothes circulates; the idea was to display an approximate
          location and also let the user decide its extension.
        </p>
      </div>
