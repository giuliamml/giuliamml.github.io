          <h5>Project Overview</h5>
          <p>
            The Clothing Loop is a clothing swap system that lets you share
            pre-loved clothes by connecting people in local communities that
            share a bag of clothes. <br />
            <mark>The Clothing Loop won the What Design Can Do competition set up
              by Impact Hub.</mark>
            <br />
            The initiative started in The Netherlands in early 2020 as a local
            alternative for clothing swap events during the lockdown. <br />
            <br />
            The initiative tackles the growing problem of overconsumption. It
            aims to change consumers habits and reduce waste, providing a fun
            and sustainable alternative to fast fashion. Currently, there are
            300 actively circulating bags and over <mark>12,000 users.</mark>

        <h1>Role</h1>
        <p>
          I joined the project in April 2020 as a volunteer Front-end
          developer because I highly valued the initiative's goal and wanted to improve my
          my coding skills within a professional environment. Initially, we were a team of 4
          contributors. During that time, I mainly contributed with some
          UI implementations. <br />
          In July 2020, as the project started to grow, I was hired as
          technical consultant. Under this role, my
          contribution extended to design and project management (read more about this <a
            href='../clothing-loop-design/'>here</a>).
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          As a technical consultant, I am responsible for implementing
          features, making design decisions, as well as team management and
          building. During the first development phase, I put together a team
          of 5 volunteer web developers whom I scouted via
          socialcoder.co.uk.

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p>
          The web app was developed to easily automate the process of user onboarding (which was previously done
          manually using a Google Form) and securely store and manage user data via a fully customized back
          office.<br />
          From the above requirements, the main functionalities designed
          include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Automated user signup flow</li>
          <li>Interactive data visualization through a map view</li>
          <li>Data management through a corresponding back office</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Development</h1>
        <p>
          For the first iteration of the web application, despite having
          designed the full application (see more about the design process
          here and the full design <a href='../clothing-loop-design/'>here</a>), the core components I
          developed
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Front-end part of the signup form used for two flow: 1. for users to
            join an existing entry (aka bag of clothes) and 2. to start a new
            one. It includes components from the Material UI library, Mapbox
            geolocation search. The form also has validation which has been
            built using Formik and Yup libraries. The Front-end communicates
            with Firebase via an end-point which has been built using using
            custom-made Firebase functions.

            <div class="img-wrapper">
              <img src="../images/gifs/form.gif" alt="" />
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            On of core functionalities of the web app, and the first users
            interact with, is the map visualization that lets the user find a
            bag of clothes circulating around their preferred location. The
            bags are displayed via an interactive Mapbox map UI, and users can
            search for a specific location, filter entries by categories, and
            sizes.

              <img src="../images/gifs/map.gif" alt="" />
            </div>
          </li>

          <li>
            The landing page was designed by a professional designer as a
            volunteer contribution to the project. My work on this component
            extended to the coding implementation, which includes a combination
            of CSS and JS animations.

      <div class="section">
        <h1>Project management</h1>

        <p>
          To manage the project's work flow and accordingly coordinate the
          work load among the team members, I use a spreadsheet that breaks
          down overall features that need to be implemented and their status:
          <span class="underline">planning/shaping</span> for features that
          are still in the design phase and not yet agreed one or outlined;
          <span class="underline">building</span> for features that in the
          process of being coded; <span class="underline">completed</span> for
          features built and approved.
        </p>

        <div class="section-img">
          <img src="../images/sheet.png" alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          In order to maintain a constant work flow, I create Github issues for
          each feature that requires implementation. Then, team members
          self-assign issues based on their preference. I found this strategy
          works quite well for this project's circumstances; it keeps the work
          flowing, even when contributors work in different time
          zones or have different availabilities, and keeps them motivated to manage their work
          independently. <br /><br />
          The majority of the communications across the team is asynchronous,
          as the contributors are based in several countries in Europe and
          Asia. However, we check in on a weekly basis via video call and
          discuss implementations on Slack.

        <h1>Technologies</h1>
        <p>
          The decision-making process for the technology used to develop the
          web application was done by the initiator of the the project and a
          senior developer who was part of the team. The tech stack
          includes:

              UI components; <span class="underline">i18Next</span> - for

              generate meta tags; <span class="underline">Formik</span> - for
