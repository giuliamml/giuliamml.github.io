            <h5>Project Overview</h5>
            <p>
              The Clothing Loop is a clothing swap system that lets you share
              pre-loved clothes by connecting people in local communities that
              share a bag of clothes. <br />
              <mark
                >The Clothing Loop won the What Design Can Do competition set up
                by Impact Hub.</mark
              >
              <br />
              The initiative started in The Netherlands in early 2020 as a local
              alternative for clothing swap events during lockdown. <br />
              <br />
              The initiative tackles the growing problem of overconsumption. It
              aims to change consumers habits and reduce waste, providing a fun
              and sustainable alternative to fast fashion. Currently, there are
              300 actively circulating bags and over <mark>12,000 users.</mark>

          <h1>Role</h1>
          <p>
            I joined the project in April 2020 as a volunteer Front-end
            developer, as I really value the initiative's goal but also to
            challenge my coding skills. At the beginning, we were a team of 4
            contributors. During that time, I mainly contributed with some
            front-end implementations. <br />
            In July 2020, as the project started to grow, I was hired as
            technical consultant for the project. Under this role, my
            contribution extended to design and project management (more on a
            separate page).

          <p>
            As a technical consultant, I am responsible for implementing
            features, design decision-making as well as team management and
            building. During the first development phase, I put together a team
            of 5 volunteer web developers which I have scouted via
            socialcoder.co.uk.

          <h1>Requirements</h1>
          <p>
            The web app was developed to easily automate the process of user
            onboarding (which previously was manually done using a google form),
            securely store and manage user data via a fully customized
            back-office.<br />
            From the above requirements, the main functionalities designed
            include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Automated user signup flow</li>
            <li>Interactive data visualization through a map view</li>
            <li>Data management through a corresponding backoffice</li>

          <h1>Development</h1>
          <p>
            For the first iteration of the web application, despite having
            designed the full application (see more about the design process
            here and the full design here), the core components I have developed
            are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Front-end part of signup form used for two flow: 1. for users to
              join an existing entry (aka bag of clothes) and 2. to start a new
              one. It includes components from Material UI library, Mapbox
              geolocation search. The form also has validation which has been
              built using Formik and Yup libraries. The Front-end communicates
              to Firebase via an end-point which has been built using using
              custom made Firebase functions.

              </div>
            </li>

            <li>
              On of core functionalities of the web app, and the first users
              interact with, is the map visualization which lets the user find a
              bag of clothes circulating around their preferred location. The
              bags are displayed via an interactive Mapbox map UI, users can
              search for a specific location, filter entries by categories and
              sizes.

            </li>

            <li>
              The landing page was designed by a professional designer as a
              volunteer contribution to the project. My work on this component
              extended to the coding implementation which includes a combination
              of CSS and JS animations.

          <h1>Project management</h1>

          <p>
            To manage the project's work flow and accordingly coordinate the
            work load through the team members, I use a spreadsheet which breaks
            down overall features that need to be implemented and their status:
            <span class="underline">planning/shaping</span> for features that
            are still at the design phase and not yet agreed one or outlined;
            <span class="underline">building</span> for features that in the
            process of being coded; <span class="underline">completed</span> for
            features built and approved.
          </p>

          <div class="section-img">
            <img src="../images/sheet.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <p>
            In order to keep a constant work flow, I create Github issues for
            each feature that requires implementation. Then, team members
            self-assign issues based on their preference. I found this strategy
            works quite well for this project's circumstances; it keeps the work
            flowing, even when contributors work on different time
            zones/availability and keeps them motivated to manage their work
            independently. <br /><br />
            The majority of the communications across the team is asynchronous
            as the contributors are based across several countries in Europe and
            Asia. However, we check-in on a weekly basis via video call and
            discuss implementations on Slack.

          <p>
            The decision-making process for the technology used to develop the
            web application was done by the initiator of the the project and a
            senior developer who was part of the team. The technologies stack
            includes:
